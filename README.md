# 22IT044 ‚Äì Design Patterns & Smart Office Command System

This repository contains two Java-based exercises that demonstrate core software design principles and pattern implementations.  
It is organized into two main modules:

- **Exercise-1** ‚Üí Demonstrates major **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** design patterns through simple Java programs and UML class diagrams.  
- **Exercise-2** ‚Üí Implements a **Smart Office Command System** using Command and Observer design patterns in Java.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- [Java JDK 8+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)  
- Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code with Java extension)  
- Command line / terminal access

---

## üöÄ Running the Exercises

###  Exercise-1
1. Open `Exercise-1` in your IDE.  
2. Navigate to the `src` folder of any pattern (e.g., `creational/Singleton/src`).  
3. Compile and run the corresponding `*.java` file, e.g.:
   ```bash
   javac SingletonDemo.java
   java SingletonDemo

### Exercise-2

1. Open Exercise-2 in your IDE.

2. Locate src/com/smartoffice/Main.java.

3. Compile and run THE corresponding `*.java` file, e.g.:
   ```bash
   javac com/smartoffice/Main.java
   java com.smartoffice.Main



Concepts Covered

Creational Patterns: Singleton, Factory

Structural Patterns: Adapter, Decorator

Behavioral Patterns: Strategy, Observer

Command Pattern: Modular command handling

Observer Pattern: Dynamic updates based on state changes

This module demonstrates key **software design patterns** categorized under Creational, Structural, and Behavioral groups.  
Each pattern includes a simple **Java implementation** and a **UML class diagram** for better understanding.
